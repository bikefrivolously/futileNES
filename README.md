A NES emulator written in rust.

I'd heard and read a bit about rust but had never given it a shot. Inspiration for this project comes from yupferris livecoding a N64 emulator in rust. 

Attribution to pcwalton's sprocketnes, which has been a great resource when I've become stuck trying to wrap my head around how to implement new types and traits in rust.

Contributions in the form of comments and pull requests are welcome, but I am using this project as an opportunity to learn rust, so please keep pull requests small. In other words, don't write the whole thing for me :)
